# Awesome Indie [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
Resources to help independent developers make money.

Making money from your own code has never been easier, but it's still hard. Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and give it a try. Be it monetizing side-projects, bootstrapping business ideas, etc.

Projects don't need to be big, actually, it's better if they are not, they just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income after the initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you reach financial independence.

Going indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)

All these resources might help inspire you and put you on the right track but in the end what matters is to **MAKE and TRY stuff**. So devour this content responsibly :)

Contributions are more than welcome.

**Notes:**

- If [$], it means it's not free and probably means I haven't tried it but still decided to add it because of the several references.
- This repo was once [#1 on Github Trending](https://medium.com/@mezood/making-money-from-your-own-code-has-never-been-easier-but-its-still-hard-2242ddaae6a1)! :_)

<!-- In general, I'd be wary of the several paid content-like products specially targeted to indie devs, so unless you can prove their value I'd like to keep them off of this list as much as possible. -->

### Communities
- **[IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)**

  Learn from profitable businesses and side projects. IndieHackers is probably the catalyst for this new wave of interest on making an independent income. It is a collection of interviews to successful developers about their products. IndieHackers has been especially interesting to follow since it's been an indie project itself. [Courtland Allen](https://twitter.com/csallen?lang=ca) has been very transparent about [how he built it](https://www.indiehackers.com/blog). The last news make one think that the forum/community will grow.

- **[Barnacl.es](https://barnacl.es/)**

  News for bootstrappers, not VC hackers. Hacker-News like forum. [Peter Bhat Harkins](https://twitter.com/pushcx) started it in early 2016 and I've found it of great value ever since. Also, it runs on [great software](https://github.com/jcs/lobsters), which is always a thing to appreciate!

### Posts

- **[Iâ€™m Launching 12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/)** by [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio)

  The challenge that started it all for Pieter. It inspired me to do something similar. What matters is to create and ship a lot, learning in the process, until something is worth pushing further.

- **[Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)** by [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11?lang=ca)

  Patrick has written over 500 posts and I have obviously not read all of them, but of the many I've read, I chose this one...

- **[Running A Software Business On 5 Hours A Week](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/03/20/running-a-software-business-on-5-hours-a-week/)** by [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11?lang=ca)

  This is just an example of a business more than one would be happy with :-) Besides liking how Tyler shares his story building Storemapper, I think he always maximizes for valuable content.

  This is the first of a series by Amy Hoy. I'll be honest, I don't even remember what this was about, just that I found it worth my time. Oh wait, yeah, Amy told me not to code, at least at first. I haven't still gotten there...

- **[The Epic Guide to Bootstrapping a SaaS Startup from Scratchâ€Šâ€”â€ŠBy Yourself](https://medium.com/@cliffordoravec/the-epic-guide-to-bootstrapping-a-saas-startup-from-scratch-by-yourself-part-1-4d834e1df8c1)** by [Clifford Oravec](https://twitter.com/cliffordoravec)

  Another series on what solo bootstrapping is about, with an offensive twist.

- **[How to get more customers](https://medium.com/product-people/how-to-get-more-customers-54f64220e430)** by [Justin Jackson](https://twitter.com/mijustin).

  This is a bit of a too specific topic for this general selection of posts, but the hell, you need to read it before it's too late. Ok, I'm starting to sound marketingy :D

- **[Indie Startups: The Ingredients of Success](https://hackernoon.com/indie-startups-the-ingredients-of-success-74531fe3a019)** by [fpgaminer](https://hackernoon.com/@fpgaminer)

  Numbers with meaning. fpgaminer analyzed all the products featured on IndieHackers, extracted some statistics and got to some conclusions. Also worth reading for the approach.

### Courses

Again, I'm not quite fond of listing [$] products made by indie developers targeting indie developers, especially because I haven't tried them myself, but due to several references I assume they are probably worth it and some people might find value in learning about them.

- **[Marketing for Developers](https://devmarketing.xyz/)** [$]
